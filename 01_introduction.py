WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a programming language that is easy to read and write. You can use it to make websites, apps, games, or even teach computers to learn things (AI).
Made by: Guido van Rossum in 1991

WHY PYTHON IS GOOD ?
Easy to learn
Code is short and clear
Works on any computer
Lots of free tools and libraries
Case-sensitive – Name and name are different
save the file(.py) extension
the name of the python chossen from monty python flying cirvus bcc show
it has large community
large standard lib/pac/module/frameworks

Python is an INTERPRETED language
INTERPRETED VS COMPLIED
Compiled languages (like C or C++) are transformed into machine code before running. Once compiled, the program runs directly on the computer’s hardware.
Interpreted languages (like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript) are executed by an interpreter at runtime, which reads your code and runs it line by line.

ADVANTGES OF INTERPRETED LANGUAGE
Easier to test and debug (you can run code snippets interactively).
More portable across different systems (the same Python code can run anywhere Python is installed).

DISADVANTGE
Generally slower than compiled languages, because the interpreter has to process the code on the fly.

WHRERE SHOULD I USE PYTHON?
Web Development** – websites and apps (Django, Flask)
Data Science & Analytics** – analyze data, make charts (Pandas, NumPy)
AI & Machine Learning** – smart apps and predictions (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Automation** – automate tasks and scripts
Game Development** – make simple games (Pygame)
Software Development** – desktop apps (Tkinter, PyQt)
Learning & Education** – great for beginners

HOW SHOULD I USE PYTHON?
Install Python – get it from python.org.
Open a place to write code – IDLE, VS Code, or online (like Replit).
Write your first program:
print("Hello, World!")
Run it – click Run or use python filename.py in terminal
