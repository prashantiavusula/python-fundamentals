What Is a Loop in Python?

Why Do We Use Loops?
Loops are useful when:
You want to repeat something many times
You want to go through items in a list
You want to run code while a condition is true

types of Loops in Python
1️⃣ for Loop
Used when you want to repeat something a specific number of times or go through a group of items.
Example idea:
“Do this 5 times”
“Print every item in a list”
It runs once for each item.

2️⃣ while Loop
Used when you want to repeat something as long as a condition is true.
Example idea:
“Keep running until the number becomes 10”
“Keep asking until the user gives the correct answer”
It stops when the condition becomes false.

for loop → Used when you know how many times to repeat
while loop → Used when you repeat based on a condition
